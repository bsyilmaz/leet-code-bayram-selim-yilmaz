**Problem Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-highest-salary/

## Table: Employee

```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
```

`id` is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.

## Problem

Write a solution to find the nth highest distinct salary from the Employee table. If there are less than n distinct salaries, return null.

## Example 1

+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
```

n = 2

**Output:** 
```
+------------------------+
| getNthHighestSalary(2) |
+------------------------+
| 200                    |
+------------------------+
```

## Example 2

**Input:** 

Employee table:
```
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
```

n = 2
